  # XXX : should be updated to mitigate timing attacks ?

  #
  # token_authenticatable was removed by Devise because of possible timing attacks
  # on tokens lookup Devise's system. Generated tokens by Devise were 20 chars long.
  # With Doorkeeper we are dealing with longer tokens of 32 chars. I think it will definitely
  # make timing attacks trickier. More, there's was no real PoC of such attack on the
  # database authentication used by Devise. JosÃ© Valim directly removed token_authenticatable
  # by fear of eventual problems because of the context (large opensource project) and
  # lack of informations.
